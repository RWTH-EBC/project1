**General** 
- Missing or false attributes in the property sets (e.g. load bearing, internal/external)  
- False definitions of objects (e.g. for IfcZones and IfcSpaces, architectural space vs MEP space)  
- Wrong usage of classes often at export from CAD software (beam vs. wall)  
- Wrong or domain oriented modelling in CAD software (e.g. parametric modelling (wall layers as walls), separated objects not defined separated)  
- Geometric objects not connected, overlaying or wrong placed (object connected to wrong storey)
