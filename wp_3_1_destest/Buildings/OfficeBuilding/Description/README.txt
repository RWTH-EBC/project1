UPDATE2: 

To read the teaserXML-file, the XML notepad software is recommended (available: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7973), but you can also use another xml-viewer or even a regular notepad.

UPDATE:
Dear all,

I started a google doc where I’m trying to add more information about the office proposal. You can find it here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQYhZOmV4FIomdaxeXo1Wpotlc_cpXU9zA_RugsAV5w/edit?usp=sharing

Please add all thoughts, comments and questions related to the Office proposal there. Thank you all!

All the best from Aachen,

Dear all,

I attached a first example of an office archetype example of TEASER. This is exported via the TEASER Web App (https://teaser.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/) and it comes with already exported simulation models based on the IBPSA thermal zone core. The main logic behind the office archetype is described here (http://rwth-ebc.github.io/TEASER/archetypes.html#office). 

It is basically a six zone approach with a defined share for each zone, based on the net floor area. The building envelope is mapped to each zone with the same share based of the total envelope. Please have a look at the teaserweb.teaserXML if you can use the information. It is very similar to Ina's residential building, just with more zones.

If you have any questions, please asked me! If you agree on using the building, i'll make a short description on github like the first residential building.

All the best,
Michael
