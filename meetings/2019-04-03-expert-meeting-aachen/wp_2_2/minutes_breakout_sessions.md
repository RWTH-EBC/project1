# IBPSA Project 1 Aachen Expert Meeting

Aachen, April 3-4, 2019

BIM
* Geometry processing
	* Work packages: defining Input (IFC) and output (IFC+SB), base code (repository + test files), algorithmic review and coding
	* Next steps: Testing of geometry algorithms
	* Possible synergies between groups:
		* E3D (E. Fichter), KIT (A. Geiger): Algorithms regarding IFC to Connection Model to Space
		* UDT (C. Nytsch-Geusen), TUC (G. Giannakis): Algorithms regarding Space to 2ndSB
		* Tsinghua (J. Lin)					

* HVAC processing
	* Created a list with necessary parameters for HVAC simulation and comparison with existing attributes and PropertySets in IFC
	* Circuit analysis via graph networks
	* Next steps: 
		* Speedup of code processing with networks
		* Check if network creation can also be done via topology	
		* create templates for export of modelica language 

* MVD
	* Pragmatic approach
	* Action item (led by K.-H. H채fele)
		* Review, consolidate and merge existing MVD parts
		* Setup of Wiki, GIT

* Controls@BIM
	* Discussion about reasonableness of linked data to connect different building domains. Would be benefitial, still open questions because of building's complexity
	* Action item (led by Dominik Schl체tter, E3D)
	* Preparation of point paper on semantic web with use case considering
		* BIM model organization
		* Hydraulic schema
		* Controls (CDL)
		* Different topology representations (BRICK, etc.)
		* State machines
		* Classification systems (ETIM, eCl@ss, etc.)
		* Linking by semantic web using RDF
	* Participants: J. O'Donnell, D. Jansen, K.-H. H채fele, D. Schl체tter, C. van Treeck, M. Wetter
